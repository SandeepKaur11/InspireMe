# InspireMe
## This algorithm is following a filtering mechanism to get the flight tickets and accomodation details within the budget put down by the user in the application.
We are utilizing live API data from skyscanner to obtain the information and process it through our servers to get the Live data and process it to get the results called as "Flight" box and "Hotel" box which combined can be called as the "Fly Box".

The inspiration for this algorithm as the name suggests is to inspire travellers to have adventures and new expereinces by letting the random selection decide their next travel destination keeping it within budget.
This happens to be the alpha version for this platform and we are willing to take it an advanced level once we got to see the feedback on this new functionality in our Flytinary application.
